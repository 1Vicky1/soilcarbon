## Database template

Original template:
[Template file](https://github.com/powellcenter-soilcarbon/soilcarbon/raw/master/inst/extdata/Master_template_orig.xlsx) (Variables with red column names are required)  
[Template instructions](/site_files/Template_info.html)

Template with flux, incubation, and interstitial data:
[Template file](https://github.com/powellcenter-soilcarbon/soilcarbon/raw/master/inst/extdata/Master_template_MPI_v10.xlsx) (Variables with red column names are required)

## Add data!

To contribute data to the soilcabon database, data files must pass a quality control step that ensures the file and it's contents are compatible with the structure and vocabulary of the database (see Template file and instructions above for explanation).
