# Contribute to soilcarbon package (making pull request)

#### This is a tutorial showing how to make a pull request. This is an example for making changes to the Template_info.xlsx file specifically. There are other ways to make pull requests but this is meant to show the simplest method.

#### Follow these steps:

### 1. After you are logged into your github account, navigate to https://github.com/powellcenter-soilcarbon/soilcarbon and create a new Fork. You will now have a copy of the repository in your personal github.

### 2. Now that you are in your personal version of the repositroy, navigate to the directory within the repositry where you want to make changes. In this tutorial we make our way to the /inst/ folder.

### 7. From this page you can see the base fork that you are requesting to pull your changes (powellcenter-soilcarbon/soilcarbon), the head fork (your fork, in this case greymonroe-extra/soilcarbon) and some information about the changes that have been made in the Commits sections. You're ready to create a pull request, so click the circled button.

### 8. You now have the chance to add any additional information about the changes that have been made. Maintainers will use this information to decide whether to accept the pull request. Add as much information as you think is needed to fully understand the changes that were made. When you're ready click 'Create pull request.'
